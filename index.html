        <h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p> For this project, I worked on a team to examine APIs stored within the Energy Information Administration website. This data represented U.S. energy supply and consumption, further reflecting the effect it had on carbon emissions and market price. Our data went back to 1990. It was found that over time, fossil fuel and nonrenewable energy sector was only slightly disrupted by renewable energy. </p> 
<p> Performed in Jupyter Notebook, this project was built through the implementation of Pandas and Matplotlib provided visual data frames and maps to illustrate data taken from APIs.  </p>
